#Requires -Version 7
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Builds and installs the Orikago language service extension into Visual Studio.

.DESCRIPTION
    VSIXInstaller silently does nothing when the installed extension carries the
    same Identity version as the package being installed - it reports success and
    leaves the old DLL in place, which looks exactly like a successful update.
    Uninstalling first makes the install unconditional, so the extension version
    never has to be bumped just to redeploy a rebuild.

    Visual Studio must be closed: VSIXInstaller exits 2004 (BlockingProcesses)
    while any devenv is running.
